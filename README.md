# 1. Installation

We have tested EvLinearSolver on machines with the following configurations

* Windows 10/11 + MATLAB R2022a



## 1.1 Dependencies
You may need add path to 'yamlmatlab' for hyperparameter settings
```
addpath(genpath('D:\Code\Mat\Utils')); % path to repo yamlmatlab
```
If you don't have this repo, please download it from https://github.com/ewiger/yamlmatlab

## 1.2 Dataset
We have released calculated normal flow on serveral sequence which could be downloaded from .
- Rotational motion estimation: sequence shapes_rotation from ECD Dataset (IJRR, 2017).
- 6 DoF tracking estimationï¼šsequence corner_slow1 from VECtor Dataset (RAL, 2021).

You can also calculate normal flow from your event data

# 2. Usage
Given input sparse normal flow, our linear solver could give

To run this code, you need **Clone this repository** into your matlab workspace.
```
git clone https://github.com/NAIL-HNU/EvLinearSolver.git
```

You need to revised path in corresponding yaml file to run your code. 
- Rotation Motion Estimation: You can run file **rotation_test** to check the result, this function output estimated angular velocity and groundtruth from IMU measurement.

- 6 DoF Tracking Estimation: You can run file **tracking_test** to check the result, this function output estimated angular velocity and linear velocity as well as groundtruth from IMU and Mocap System measurement.

- Differential Homography Estimation: will be updated soon.
